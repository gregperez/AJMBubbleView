# AJMBubbleView

## Description
AJMBubbleView is a dynamic bubble controlled-dragged by the user. It displays a number of notifications in a badge and when it
is released, it will stick to the nearest corner of the screen. 

This view has the option of being removed when it reaches the "red erase zone" (a UIView located at the bottom of the screen).
